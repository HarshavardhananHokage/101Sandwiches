    Cook bacon until crispy, then drain on paper towels.\n
    Toast the 8 slices of bread.\n
    Spread 1 tablespoon mayo on each slice of toasted bread. (More or less, to taste).\n
    Add 1 slice of lettuce to 4 pieces of mayo-spread toast.\n
    Add 2 slices of tomato on top of lettuce.\n
    Arrange 3 slices of bacon evenly on top of tomato. (Break bacon slices in half to fit, if needed.).\n
    Add 1 slice of lettuce on top of bacon.\n
    Put the remaining 4 pieces of mayo-spread toast on top to finish the sandwiches.\n
    Enjoy!\n
    NOTE: I also like to butter the toast slices before adding the mayo, higher in fat, but tastier, in my opinion!
